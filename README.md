# üì∏ esp32-multicli

Welcome to `esp32-multicli`! This project revolves around creating a web interface for displaying feeds from ESP32-Camera modules or IP cameras. It's a fantastic way to integrate and monitor multiple camera feeds using the versatile ESP32 platform. Let's dive into the world of IoT and home surveillance with this exciting project!

## üìã Required Equipment

To get started, you'll need the following items:
- **2x ESP32-CAM OV2640**: These are the camera modules that will capture and send the video feed.
- **1x ESP32 (Any Variant)**: This will act as the central unit to process and display the camera feeds.
- **Arduino IDE**: The integrated development environment (IDE) to program your ESP32 modules.
- **A Mobile Device**: For accessing the web interface and viewing the camera feeds.

## üõ† Setup Guide

Setting up your ESP32-CAMs is straightforward. Follow these steps to get everything up and running:

### Step 1: Download and Open the ESP-CAM Server

First, grab the ESP-CAM server code from here: [ESP-cam-server](https://github.com/easytarget/esp32-cam-webserver). Open the downloaded code in the Arduino IDE.

### Step 2: Modify Configuration Files

Change a couple of lines in the ESP-CAM code to prevent the camera from going into access point mode. You'll find these under the section "Primary config, or defaults." Replace `myconfig.h` with `myconfig.sample.h`.

### Step 3: Set Up Wi-Fi Credentials

Configure your Wi-Fi SSID and password in the ESP-CAM settings. Remember to use the same credentials across all devices. Upload this sketch to your ESP32-cam boards.

### Step 4: Upload to ESP32

Open the `esp-cam-multicli.ino` file and input the same SSID and password. Upload this sketch to your ESP32 board.

### Step 5: Enjoy Your Project

Once everything is set up, enjoy monitoring your space with your newly configured ESP32-CAM setup!

### Note about the esp

The esp can only handle up to 3 cameras with a moderate amount of performance loss so this project is locked to only 2 cameras.
